The Buddy CLI is used to manage Buddy.Works pipelines from the terminal.

### About Buddy.Works

[**Buddy.Works**](https://buddy.works/) is a Docker-based CI server with auto-deployment tools. Its core feature are pipelines that let developers automate repeatable tasks, for example: build, test and deploy applications, run SSH scripts, monitor websites, build and push Docker images, or send custom Slack notifications – automatically on push, manually on click, or on time interval.

How Buddy CLI works
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the CLI installed, you can trigger pipeline executions without entering the service's GUI. Here's an example use case:

1. A developer pushes a bugfix to the DEV branch:
```
git commit -m 'quick bugfix'
git push dev
```

2. Once the bugfix is pushed, he runs a pipeline assigned to the DEV branch that will test the changes and deploy the application to the DEV server:
```
buddy-cli pl run dev
```

3. When the execution is over, he checks if the tests have passed and deployment went through:
```
buddy-cli pl inspect
```

**NOTE**: To use Buddy CLI, you must first sign up to [Buddy.Works](https://buddy.works).

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Run pipelines from the command line
- Check pipeline status
- List executions
- List pipelines
- List projects
- List workspaces

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
npm install -g buddyworks-cli
```

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tool will be immediately available after the installation.
You can call `buddy-cli -h` to find out more about commands available.

In order to call any command, you must first generate an auth token in your Buddy.Works [my-id](https://app.buddy.works/api-tokens) settings.
If you are using Buddy Enterprise (standalone) you need to do the same, but in your own instance. Your token must have these scopes in order to work properly:

* WORKSPACE – Manage workspace and its objects
* EXECUTION_INFO – Get pipelines
* EXECUTION_RUN – Run pipelines

### Pipeline operations
```
buddy-cli pipeline <cmd>
```
Shortcut:
```
buddy-cli pl <cmd>
```
The `pipeline` parameter is the ID of the pipeline. You can get it from the pipeline list command described below.
Apart from that you also need the passed token, workspace and project. 

The arguments are mandatory, but you can store them in Buddy.Works as environment variables or through a config command that will enable you to shorten your commands (more below).

### Workspace operations
```

```
buddy-cli ws <cmd>
```
The same rules for arguments apply here: some mandatory arguments, like workspace name, can be stored in the config or in env variables.

#### List workspaces
```
buddy-cli ws ls
```
Options:
```
 -v, --version  Show version
 -h, --help     Show help
 -j, --json     Output json
 -t, --token    Token to authenticate request

```

---

### Config operations
```
buddy-cli config <cmd>
```
Shortcut:
```
buddy-cli cf <cmd>
```
The `config` command is used to store some arguments for future use. 
For example, if you often run the same pipeline, you can store the command params in config:
```
buddy-cli cf set token my-token
buddy-cli cf set workspace my-workspace
buddy-cli cf set project my-project
buddy-cli cf set pipeline my-pipeline
```
The next time you'll want to run your pipeline, just call
```
buddy-cli pl run
```
Please mind you can override the default config params with a standard `command --param`

#### Set config key
```
buddy-cli cf set <key> [val]
```
The key name is mandatory and can be one of the following values:
* token – The token used to authenticate the request
* workspace – The name of the workspace in which the command is run
* project – The name of the project in the workspace
* pipeline – The ID of the pipeline in the project
* url – The base URL for the API endpoint. By default, we point to our hosted version  of the API (api.buddy.works), but you can also point this URL to your Buddy Enterprise (standalone) API endpoint (ip/api).

Options:
```
  -v, --version  Show version
  -h, --help     Show help
  -j, --json     Output json
```

#### Get config key
```
buddy-cli cf get [key]
```
The key can be one of the following values:
* token – The token used to authenticate the request
* workspace – The name of the workspace in which the command is run
* project – The name of the project in the workspace
* pipeline – The ID of the pipeline in the project
* url – The base URL for the API endpoint. By default, we point to our hosted version  of the API (api.buddy.works), but you can also
* all – Returns all options

By default, all keys are returned.

#### Clear config
```
buddy-cli cf clear
```
This command resets the config to default values (empties all keys and resets the URL to `api.buddy.works`)

### Aliases
You can use custom aliases for config properties. You can save multiple aliases for any resource:
* Token
* Workspace
* Project
* Pipeline
* Url

#### Set alias
```
buddy-cli al set <key> [val]
```
The key name is mandatory and can be any word (these name you will use as parameter value). To clear alias pass empty val.

Options:
```
  -v, --version  Show version
  -h, --help     Show help
  -j, --json     Output json
```
#### Get alias
```
buddy-cli al get [key]
```
The key is your friendly name. By default, all keys are returned.

#### Clear config
```
buddy-cli al clear
```
This command remove all stored aliases.

#### Example usage
```
myWorkspace - name of registered workspace
```
To list projects in these workspace normally you would call:
```
buddy-cli pj ls -w myWorkspace
```
Using aliases:
```
buddy-cli al set foo myWorkspace
buddy-cli pj ls -w foo
```
You can also use aliases in stored config keys:
```
buddy-cli al set foo myWorkspace
buddy-cli cf set workspace foo
buddy-cli pj ls
```

Thanks to aliases you no longer need to remember ids of your pipelines, projects names and so on. Just save it under your friendly alias. 

---

#### Environment variables
You can use environment variables to store your config values. This feature is very useful if you want to use buddy-cli in a Continuous Integration (CI) and/or Continuous Deployment (CD) environment. 

This is the list of variables you can use:
* BUDDY_CLI_TOKEN
* BUDDY_CLI_WORKSPACE
* BUDDY_CLI_PROJECT
* BUDDY_CLI_PIPELINE
* BUDDY_CLI_URL

Buddy CLI uses parameters in the following order:

1. Command line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Config variables

If none of the above is found and the argument is mandatory, it will throw an error.

Environment variables are also [available directly](https://buddy.works/knowledge/deployments/how-use-environment-variables) in the Buddy.Works system.
